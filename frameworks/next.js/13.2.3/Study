/* Pages */
* Pre-rendering
By default, Next.js pre-renders every page

Static Generation (Recommended)
 - generated at build time & reused
Server-side Rendering
 - generated on each request

Static Generation with data
 - getStaticProps(async): content from external data
 - getStaticPaths(async): Paths from external data

Priority
 1. Static Generation
 // if user's request (frequently updated data || content changes on every request)
 2 - a. Static Generation & Client-side data fetching
     b. Use Server-Side Rendering

* Server-side Rendering
HTML is generated on each request
 - getServerSideProps(async)


/* Data Fetching */

/* getServerSideProps */
If don't need to render the data during the request, considerclient side || getStaticProps

* Fetching data on the client side
page contains frequently updating data
donâ€™t need to pre-render the data
 1. immediately show the page without data
   (Parts of the page can be pre-rendered using Static Generation)
   (You can show loading states for missing data)
 2. fetch the data on the client side and display it when ready
   (ex - user dashboard)

/* getStaticProps */ (gets called at build time on server-side)
pre-render at build time using the props returned by getStaticProps
no access to the incoming request(query parameters || HTTP headers) as it generates static HTML
if need, consider  Middleware with getStaticProps

Preview Mode
temporarily bypass static generation
render the page at request time instead of build time
want to preview drafts before published
