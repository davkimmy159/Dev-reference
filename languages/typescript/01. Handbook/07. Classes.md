If you intend to definitely initialize a field through means other than the constructor (for example, maybe an external library is filling in part of your class for you), you can use the definite assignment assertion operator, `!`:
```ts
class OKGreeter {

  // Not initialized, but no error
  name!: string;
}
```

### `readonly`
Fields may be prefixed with the `readonly` modifier. This prevents assignments to the field outside of the constructor.
```ts
class Greeter {
  readonly name: string = "world";

  constructor(otherName?: string) {
    if (otherName !== undefined) {
      this.name = otherName;
    }
  }

  err() {

    // Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
    this.name = "not ok";
  }
}
const g = new Greeter();

// Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
g.name = "also not ok";
```

### 생성자
Class constructors are very similar to functions. You can add parameters with type annotations, default values, and overloads:
```ts
class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;

  // Normal signature with defaults
  constructor(x = 0, y = 0) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```
```ts
class Point {
  x: number = 0;
  y: number = 0;

  // Constructor overloads
  constructor(x: number, y: number);
  constructor(xy: string);
  constructor(x: string | number, y: number = 0) {
    // Code logic here
  }
}
```

There are just a few differences between class constructor signatures and function signatures:
- Constructors can’t have type parameters - these belong on the outer class declaration, which we’ll learn about later
- Constructors can’t have return type annotations - the class instance type is always what’s returned

#### Super Calls
Just as in JavaScript, if you have a base class, you’ll need to call `super();` in your constructor body before using any `this.` members:
```ts
class Base {
  k = 4;
}

class Derived extends Base {
  constructor() {

    // Prints a wrong value in ES5; throws exception in ES6
    // 'super' must be called before accessing 'this' in the constructor of a derived class.
    console.log(this.k);
    super();
  }
}
```

Forgetting to call `super` is an easy mistake to make in JavaScript, but TypeScript will tell you when it’s necessary.

### Methods
A function property on a class is called a method. Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:
```ts
class Point {
  x = 10;
  y = 10;

  scale(n: number): void {
    this.x *= n;
    this.y *= n;
  }
}
```

Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript doesn’t add anything else new to methods.

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to access fields and other methods via `this.`. An unqualified name in a method body will always refer to something in the enclosing scope:
```ts
let x: number = 0;

class C {
  x: string = "hello";

  m() {

    // This is trying to modify 'x' from line 1, not the class property
    // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
    x = "world";
  }
}
```

### Getters · Setters
Classes can also have accessors:
```ts
class C {

  _length = 0;

  get length() {
    return this._length;
  }

  set length(value) {
    this._length = value;
  }
}
```

<br />

<hr />

Note that a field-backed get/set pair with no extra logic is very rarely useful in JavaScript. It’s fine to expose public fields if you don’t need to add additional logic during the get/set operations.

<hr />

TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:
- If `get` exists but no `set`, the property is automatically `readonly`
- If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred from the return type of the getter

Since TypeScript 4.3, it is possible to have accessors with different types for getting and setting.
```ts
class Thing {
  _size = 0;

  get size(): number {
    return this._size;
  }

  set size(value: string | number | boolean) {
    let num = Number(value);

    // Don't allow NaN, Infinity, etc
    if (!Number.isFinite(num)) {
      this._size = 0;
      return;
    }

    this._size = num;
  }
}
```

### Index Signatures
Classes can declare index signatures; these work the same as Index Signatures for other object types:
```ts
class MyClass {
  [s: string]: boolean | ((s: string) => boolean);

  check(s: string) {
    return this[s] as boolean;
  }
}
```

Because the index signature type needs to also capture the types of methods, it’s not easy to usefully use these types. Generally it’s better to store indexed data in another place instead of on the class instance itself.

<br />

## Class Heritage

Like other languages with object-oriented features, classes in JavaScript can inherit from base classes.

### `implements` Clauses
You can use an `implements` clause to check that a class satisfies a particular `interface`. An error will be issued if a class fails to correctly implement it:
```ts
interface Pingable {
  ping(): void;
}

class Sonar implements Pingable {
  ping() {
    console.log("ping!");
  }
}

// Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
// Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.
class Ball implements Pingable {
  pong() {
    console.log("pong!");
  }
}
```

Classes may also implement multiple interfaces, e.g. `class C implements A, B {`.

#### Cautions
It’s important to understand that an `implements` clause is only a check that the class can be treated as the interface type. It doesn’t change the type of the class or its methods at all. A common source of error is to assume that an `implements` clause will change the class type - it doesn’t!
```ts
interface Checkable {
  check(name: string): boolean;
}

class NameChecker implements Checkable {

  // Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  check(s) {

    // any
    console.log(s.toLowerCase());

    // Notice no error here
    return s.toLowerCase() === "ok";
  }
}
```

In this example, we perhaps expected that `s`’s type would be influenced by the `name: string` parameter of `check`. It is not - `implements` clauses don’t change how the class body is checked or its type inferred.

Similarly, implementing an interface with an optional property doesn’t create that property:
```ts
interface A {
  x: number;
  y?: number;
}

class C implements A {
  x = 0;
}

const c = new C();

// Property 'y' does not exist on type 'C'.
c.y = 10;
```

### `extends` Clauses
Classes may extend from a base class. A derived class has all the properties and methods of its base class, and can also define additional members.
```ts
class Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("Moving along!");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  woof(times: number) {
    for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
      console.log("woof!");
    }
  }
}

const d = new Dog();

// Base class method
d.move();

// Derived class method
d.woof(3);
```

#### Overriding Methods
Background Reading:
super keyword (MDN)
A derived class can also override a base class field or property. You can use the `super`. syntax to access base class methods. Note that because JavaScript classes are a simple lookup object, there is no notion of a “super field”.

TypeScript enforces that a derived class is always a subtype of its base class.

For example, here’s a legal way to override a method:
```ts
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  greet(name?: string) {
    if (name === undefined) {
      super.greet();
    } else {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
    }
  }
}

const d = new Derived();
d.greet();
d.greet("reader");
```

It’s important that a derived class follow its base class contract. Remember that it’s very common (and always legal!) to refer to a derived class instance through a base class reference:
```ts
// Alias the derived instance through a base class reference
const b: Base = d;

// No problem
b.greet();
```

What if `Derived` didn’t follow `Base`’s contract?
```ts
class Base {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {

  // Make this parameter required
  // Property 'greet' in type 'Derived' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Base'.
  // Type '(name: string) => void' is not assignable to type '() => void'.
  // Target signature provides too few arguments. Expected 1 or more, but got 0.
  greet(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
}
```

If we compiled this code despite the error, this sample would then crash:
```ts
const b: Base = new Derived();
// Crashes because "name" will be undefined
b.greet();
```

#### Type-only Field Declarations
When `target >= ES2022` or `useDefineForClassFields` <sub>(옵션)</sub> is `true`, class fields are initialized after the parent class constructor completes, overwriting any value set by the parent class. This can be a problem when you only want to re-declare a more accurate type for an inherited field. To handle these cases, you can write `declare` to indicate to TypeScript that there should be no runtime effect for this field declaration.
```ts
interface Animal {
  dateOfBirth: any;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: any;
}

class AnimalHouse {
  resident: Animal;
  constructor(animal: Animal) {
    this.resident = animal;
  }
}

class DogHouse extends AnimalHouse {

  // Does not emit JavaScript code,
  // only ensures the types are correct
  declare resident: Dog;
  constructor(dog: Dog) {
    super(dog);
  }
}
```

#### Initialization Order
The order that JavaScript classes initialize can be surprising in some cases. Let’s consider this code:
```ts
class Base {
  name = "base";

  constructor() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name);
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  name = "derived";
}

// Prints "base", not "derived"
const d = new Derived();

```
What happened here?

The order of class initialization, as defined by JavaScript, is:
1. The base class fields are initialized
2. The base class constructor runs
3. The derived class fields are initialized
4. The derived class constructor runs

This means that the base class constructor saw its own value for `name` during its own constructor, because the derived class field initializations hadn’t run yet.

#### Inheriting Built-in Types

<br />

<hr />

Note: If you don’t plan to inherit from built-in types like `Array`, `Error`, `Map`, etc. or your compilation target is explicitly set to `ES6`/`ES2015` or above, you may skip this section

<hr />

In ES2015, constructors which return an object implicitly substitute the value of `this` for any callers of `super(...)`. It is necessary for generated constructor code to capture any potential return value of `super(...)` and replace it with `this`.

As a result, subclassing `Error`, `Array`, and others may no longer work as expected. This is due to the fact that constructor functions for `Error`, `Array`, and the like use ECMAScript 6’s `new.target` to adjust the prototype chain; however, there is no way to ensure a value for `new.target` when invoking a constructor in ECMAScript 5. Other downlevel compilers generally have the same limitation by default.

For a subclass like the following:
```ts
class MsgError extends Error {
  constructor(m: string) {
    super(m);
  }

  sayHello() {
    return "hello " + this.message;
  }
}
```

you may find that:
- methods may be `undefined` on objects returned by constructing these subclasses, so calling `sayHello` will result in an error.
- `instanceof` will be broken between instances of the subclass and their instances, so `(new MsgError()) instanceof MsgError` will return `false`.

As a recommendation, you can manually adjust the prototype immediately after any `super(...)` calls.
```ts
class MsgError extends Error {
  constructor(m: string) {
    super(m);

    // Set the prototype explicitly.
    Object.setPrototypeOf(this, MsgError.prototype);
  }

  sayHello() {
    return "hello " + this.message;
  }
}
```

However, any subclass of `MsgError` will have to manually set the prototype as well. For runtimes that don’t support `Object.setPrototypeOf`, you may instead be able to use `__proto__`.

Unfortunately, these workarounds will not work on Internet Explorer 10 and prior. One can manually copy methods from the prototype onto the instance itself (i.e. `MsgError.prototype` onto `this`), but the prototype chain itself cannot be fixed.

<br />

## Member Visibility
You can use TypeScript to control whether certain methods or properties are visible to code outside the class.

### `public`
The default visibility of class members is `public`. A `public` member can be accessed anywhere:
```ts
class Greeter {
  public greet() {
    console.log("hi!");
  }
}
const g = new Greeter();
g.greet();
```

Because `public` is already the default visibility modifier, you don’t ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for style/readability reasons.

### `protected`
`protected` members are only visible to subclasses of the class they’re declared in.
```ts
class Greeter {
  public greet() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.getName());
  }

  protected getName() {
    return "hi";
  }
}

class SpecialGreeter extends Greeter {
  public howdy() {
    // OK to access protected member here
    console.log("Howdy, " + this.getName());
  }
}
const g = new SpecialGreeter();
g.greet(); // OK

// Property 'getName' is protected and only accessible within class 'Greeter' and its subclasses.
g.getName();
```

#### Exposure of `protected` members
Derived classes need to follow their base class contracts, but may choose to expose a subtype of base class with more capabilities. This includes making `protected` members `public`:
```ts
class Base {
  protected m = 10;
}

class Derived extends Base {

  // No modifier, so default is 'public'
  m = 15;
}
const d = new Derived();
console.log(d.m); // OK
```

Note that `Derived` was already able to freely read and write `m`, so this doesn’t meaningfully alter the “security” of this situation. The main thing to note here is that in the derived class, we need to be careful to repeat the `protected` modifier if this exposure isn’t intentional.

#### Cross-hierarchy `protected` access
Different OOP languages disagree about whether it’s legal to access a `protected` member through a base class reference:
```ts
class Base {
  protected x: number = 1;
}

class Derived1 extends Base {
  protected x: number = 5;
}

class Derived2 extends Base {

  f1(other: Derived2) {
    other.x = 10;
  }

  f2(other: Derived1) {

    // Property 'x' is protected and only accessible within class 'Derived1' and its subclasses.
    other.x = 10;
  }
}
```

Java, for example, considers this to be legal. On the other hand, C# and C++ chose that this code should be illegal.

TypeScript sides with C# and C++ here, because accessing `x` in `Derived2` should only be legal from `Derived2`’s subclasses, and `Derived1` isn’t one of them. Moreover, if accessing `x` through a `Derived1` reference is illegal (which it certainly should be!), then accessing it through a base class reference should never improve the situation.

See also Why Can’t I Access A Protected Member From A Derived Class? which explains more of C#‘s reasoning.

### `private`
`private` is like `protected`, but doesn’t allow access to the member even from subclasses:
```ts
class Base {
  private x = 0;
}

const b = new Base();

// Can't access from outside the class
// Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.
console.log(b.x);
```
```ts
class Derived extends Base {
  showX() {

    // Can't access in subclasses
    // Property 'x' is private and only accessible within class 'Base'.
    console.log(this.x);
  }
}
```

Because `private` members aren’t visible to derived classes, a derived class can’t increase their visibility:
```ts
class Base {
  private x = 0;
}

// Class 'Derived' incorrectly extends base class 'Base'.
class Derived extends Base {

  // Property 'x' is private in type 'Base' but not in type 'Derived'.
  x = 1;
}
```

#### Cross-instance `private` access
Different OOP languages disagree about whether different instances of the same class may access each others’ `private` members. While languages like Java, C#, C++, Swift, and PHP allow this, Ruby does not.

TypeScript does allow cross-instance `private` access:
```ts
class A {
  private x = 10;

  public sameAs(other: A) {

    // No error
    return other.x === this.x;
  }
}
```

#### Caveats
Like other aspects of TypeScript’s type system, `private` and `protected` are only enforced during type checking.

This means that JavaScript runtime constructs like `in` or simple property lookup can still access a `private` or `protected` member:
```ts
class MySafe {
  private secretKey = 12345;
}
```
```ts
// In a JavaScript file...
const s = new MySafe();

// Will print 12345
console.log(s.secretKey);
```

`private` also allows access using bracket notation during type checking. This makes `private`-declared fields potentially easier to access for things like unit tests, with the drawback that these fields are soft private and don’t strictly enforce privacy.
```ts
class MySafe {
  private secretKey = 12345;
}

const s = new MySafe();

// Not allowed during type checking
// Property 'secretKey' is private and only accessible within class 'MySafe'.
console.log(s.secretKey);

// OK
console.log(s["secretKey"]);
```

Unlike TypeScripts’s private, JavaScript’s private fields (#) remain private after compilation and do not provide the previously mentioned escape hatches like bracket notation access, making them hard private.
```ts
class Dog {
  #barkAmount = 0;
  personality = "happy";

  constructor() {}
}
```
```ts
"use strict";
class Dog {
  #barkAmount = 0;
  personality = "happy";

  constructor() { }
}
```

When compiling to ES2021 or less, TypeScript will use WeakMaps in place of `#`.
```ts
"use strict";
var _Dog_barkAmount;

class Dog {
  constructor() {
    _Dog_barkAmount.set(this, 0);
    this.personality = "happy";
  }
}

_Dog_barkAmount = new WeakMap();
```

If you need to protect values in your class from malicious actors, you should use mechanisms that offer hard runtime privacy, such as closures, WeakMaps, or private fields. Note that these added privacy checks during runtime could affect performance.
