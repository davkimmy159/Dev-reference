- 
- Note that when using both `number` and `string` indexers, the type returned from a numeric indexer must be a subtype of the type returned from the string indexer. This is because when indexing with a number, JavaScript will actually convert that to a string before indexing into an object. That means that indexing with 100 (a number) is the same thing as indexing with "100" (a string), so the two need to be consistent.
```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

// Error: indexing with a numeric string might get you a completely separate type of Animal!
interface NotOkay {
  [x: number]: Animal;
'number' index type 'Animal' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'Dog'.
  [x: string]: Dog;
}
```

##### 문자열 index signatures
  - 사전 패턴 유용
  - 

While string index signatures are a powerful way to describe the “dictionary” pattern, they also enforce that all properties match their return type. This is because a string index declares that `obj.property` is also available as `obj["property"]`. In the following example, `name`’s type does not match the string index’s type, and the type checker gives an error:
```ts
interface NumberDictionary {
  [index: string]: number;

  length: number; // ok

  // Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'string' index type 'number'.
  name: string;
}
```

However, properties of different types are acceptable if the index signature is a union of the property types:
```ts
interface NumberOrStringDictionary {
  [index: string]: number | string;
  length: number; // ok, length is a number
  name: string; // ok, name is a string
}
```

Finally, you can make index signatures `readonly` in order to prevent assignment to their indices:
```ts
interface ReadonlyStringArray {
  readonly [index: number]: string;
}

let myArray: ReadonlyStringArray = getReadOnlyStringArray();

// Index signature in type 'ReadonlyStringArray' only permits reading.
myArray[2] = "Mallory";
```

You can’t set `myArray[2]` because the index signature is `readonly`.

<br />

## Excess Property Checks
Where and how an object is assigned a type can make a difference in the type system. One of the key examples of this is in excess property checking, which validates the object more thoroughly when it is created and assigned to an object type during creation.
```ts
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): { color: string; area: number } {
  return {
    color: config.color || "red",
    area: config.width ? config.width * config.width : 20,
  };
}

// Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?
let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });
```

Notice the given argument to `createSquare` is spelled colour instead of `color`. In plain JavaScript, this sort of thing fails silently.

You could argue that this program is correctly typed, since the `width` properties are compatible, there’s no `color` property present, and the extra `colour` property is insignificant.

However, TypeScript takes the stance that there’s probably a bug in this code. Object literals get special treatment and undergo excess property checking when assigning them to other variables, or passing them as arguments. If an object literal has any properties that the “target type” doesn’t have, you’ll get an error:
```ts
// Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'colour' does not exist in type 'SquareConfig'. Did you mean to write 'color'?
let mySquare = createSquare({ colour: "red", width: 100 });
```

Getting around these checks is actually really simple. The easiest method is to just use a type assertion:
```ts

let mySquare = createSquare({ width: 100, opacity: 0.5 } as SquareConfig);
```

However, a better approach might be to add a string index signature if you’re sure that the object can have some extra properties that are used in some special way. If `SquareConfig` can have `color` and `width` properties with the above types, but could also have any number of other properties, then we could define it like so:
```ts
interface SquareConfig {
  color?: string;
  width?: number;
  [propName: string]: any;
}
```

Here we’re saying that `SquareConfig` can have any number of properties, and as long as they aren’t `color` or `width`, their types don’t matter.

One final way to get around these checks, which might be a bit surprising, is to assign the object to another variable: Since assigning `squareOptions` won’t undergo excess property checks, the compiler won’t give you an error:
```ts
let squareOptions = { colour: "red", width: 100 };
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
```

The above workaround will work as long as you have a common property between `squareOptions` and `SquareConfig`. In this example, it was the property `width`. It will however, fail if the variable does not have any common object property. For example:
```ts
let squareOptions = { colour: "red" };

// Type '{ colour: string; }' has no properties in common with type 'SquareConfig'.
let mySquare = createSquare(squareOptions);
```

Keep in mind that for simple code like above, you probably shouldn’t be trying to “get around” these checks. For more complex object literals that have methods and hold state, you might need to keep these techniques in mind, but a majority of excess property errors are actually bugs.

That means if you’re running into excess property checking problems for something like option bags, you might need to revise some of your type declarations. In this instance, if it’s okay to pass an object with both a `color` or `colour` property to `createSquare`, you should fix up the definition of `SquareConfig` to reflect that.

<br />

## Extending Types
It’s pretty common to have types that might be more specific versions of other types. For example, we might have a `BasicAddress` type that describes the fields necessary for sending letters and packages in the U.S.
```ts
interface BasicAddress {
  name?: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}
```

In some situations that’s enough, but addresses often have a unit number associated with them if the building at an address has multiple units. We can then describe an `AddressWithUnit`.
```ts
interface AddressWithUnit {
  name?: string;
  unit: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}
```

This does the job, but the downside here is that we had to repeat all the other fields from `BasicAddress` when our changes were purely additive. Instead, we can extend the original `BasicAddress` type and just add the new fields that are unique to `AddressWithUnit`.
```ts
interface BasicAddress {
  name?: string;
  street: string;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  postalCode: string;
}

interface AddressWithUnit extends BasicAddress {
  unit: string;
}
```

The `extends` keyword on an `interface` allows us to effectively copy members from other named types, and add whatever new members we want. This can be useful for cutting down the amount of type declaration boilerplate we have to write, and for signaling intent that several different declarations of the same property might be related. For example, `AddressWithUnit` didn’t need to repeat the `street` property, and because `street` originates from `BasicAddress`, a reader will know that those two types are related in some way.

`interfaces` can also extend from multiple types.
```ts
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}

interface ColorfulCircle extends Colorful, Circle {}

const cc: ColorfulCircle = {
  color: "red",
  radius: 42,
};
```

<br />

## Intersection Types
`interface`s allowed us to build up new types from other types by extending them. TypeScript provides another construct called intersection types that is mainly used to combine existing object types.

An intersection type is defined using the `&` operator.
```ts
interface Colorful {
  color: string;
}

interface Circle {
  radius: number;
}

type ColorfulCircle = Colorful & Circle;
```

Here, we’ve intersected `Colorful` and `Circle` to produce a new type that has all the members of `Colorful` and `Circle`.
```ts
function draw(circle: Colorful & Circle) {
  console.log(`Color was ${circle.color}`);
  console.log(`Radius was ${circle.radius}`);
}

// okay
draw({ color: "blue", radius: 42 });

// oops
// Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'raidus' does not exist in type 'Colorful & Circle'. Did you mean to write 'radius'?
draw({ color: "red", raidus: 42 });
```

<br />

## Interfaces vs Intersections
We just looked at two ways to combine types which are similar, but are actually subtly different. With interfaces, we could use an `extends` clause to extend from other types, and we were able to do something similar with intersections and name the result with a type alias. The principal difference between the two is how conflicts are handled, and that difference is typically one of the main reasons why you’d pick one over the other between an interface and a type alias of an intersection type.

<br />

## Generic Object Types
Let’s imagine a `Box` type that can contain any value - `string`s, `number`s, `Giraffe`s, whatever.
```ts
interface Box {
  contents: any;
}
```

Right now, the `contents` property is typed as `any`, which works, but can lead to accidents down the line.

We could instead use `unknown`, but that would mean that in cases where we already know the type of `contents`, we’d need to do precautionary checks, or use error-prone type assertions.
```ts
interface Box {
  contents: unknown;
}

let x: Box = {
  contents: "hello world",
};

// we could check 'x.contents'
if (typeof x.contents === "string") {
  console.log(x.contents.toLowerCase());
}

// or we could use a type assertion
console.log((x.contents as string).toLowerCase());
```

One type safe approach would be to instead scaffold out different `Box` types for every type of `contents`.
```ts
interface NumberBox {
  contents: number;
}

interface StringBox {
  contents: string;
}

interface BooleanBox {
  contents: boolean;
}
```

But that means we’ll have to create different functions, or overloads of functions, to operate on these types.
```ts
function setContents(box: StringBox, newContents: string): void;
function setContents(box: NumberBox, newContents: number): void;
function setContents(box: BooleanBox, newContents: boolean): void;
function setContents(box: { contents: any }, newContents: any) {
  box.contents = newContents;
}
```

That’s a lot of boilerplate. Moreover, we might later need to introduce new types and overloads. This is frustrating, since our box types and overloads are all effectively the same.

Instead, we can make a generic `Box` type which declares a type parameter.
```ts
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
```

You might read this as “A `Box` of `Type` is something whose `contents` have type `Type`”. Later on, when we refer to `Box`, we have to give a type argument in place of `Type`.
```ts
let box: Box<string>;
```

Think of `Box` as a template for a real type, where `Type` is a placeholder that will get replaced with some other type. When TypeScript sees `Box<string>`, it will replace every instance of `Type` in `Box<Type>` with `string`, and end up working with something like `{ contents: string }`. In other words, `Box<string>` and our earlier `StringBox` work identically.
```ts
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}

interface StringBox {
  contents: string;
}

// boxA.contents
// - Box<string>.contents: string
let boxA: Box<string> = { contents: "hello" };

// boxB.contents
// - StringBox.contents: string
let boxB: StringBox = { contents: "world" };
```

`Box` is reusable in that `Type` can be substituted with anything. That means that when we need a box for a new type, we don’t need to declare a new `Box` type at all (though we certainly could if we wanted to).
```ts
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}

interface Apple {
  // ....
}

// Same as '{ contents: Apple }'.
type AppleBox = Box<Apple>;
```

This also means that we can avoid overloads entirely by instead using generic functions.
```ts
function setContents<Type>(box: Box<Type>, newContents: Type) {
  box.contents = newContents;
}
```

It is worth noting that type aliases can also be generic. We could have defined our new `Box<Type>` interface, which was:
```ts
interface Box<Type> {
  contents: Type;
}
```

by using a type alias instead:
```ts
type Box<Type> = {
  contents: Type;
};
```

Since type aliases, unlike interfaces, can describe more than just object types, we can also use them to write other kinds of generic helper types.
```ts
type OrNull<Type> = Type | null;

type OneOrMany<Type> = Type | Type[];

// type OneOrManyOrNull<Type> = OneOrMany<Type> | null
type OneOrManyOrNull<Type> = OrNull<OneOrMany<Type>>;

// type OneOrManyOrNullStrings = OneOrMany<string> | null
type OneOrManyOrNullStrings = OneOrManyOrNull<string>;
```

We’ll circle back to type aliases in just a little bit.

### `Array` Type
Generic object types are often some sort of container type that work independently of the type of elements they contain. It’s ideal for data structures to work this way so that they’re re-usable across different data types.

It turns out we’ve been working with a type just like that throughout this handbook: the `Array` type. Whenever we write out types like `number[]` or `string[]`, that’s really just a shorthand for `Array<number>` and `Array<string>`.
```ts
function doSomething(value: Array<string>) {
  // ...
}

let myArray: string[] = ["hello", "world"];

// either of these work!
doSomething(myArray);
doSomething(new Array("hello", "world"));
```

Much like the `Box` type above, `Array` itself is a generic type.
```ts
// Global type 'Array' must have 1 type parameter(s).
// All declarations of 'Array' must have identical type parameters.
interface Array<Type> {

  /**
   * Gets or sets the length of the array.
   */
  length: number;

  /**
   * Removes the last element from an array and returns it.
   */
  pop(): Type | undefined;

  /**
   * Appends new elements to an array, and returns the new length of the array.
   */
  // A rest parameter must be of an array type.
  push(...items: Type[]): number;

  // ...
}
```

Modern JavaScript also provides other data structures which are generic, like `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, and `Promise<T>`. All this really means is that because of how `Map`, `Set`, and `Promise` behave, they can work with any sets of types.

### `ReadonlyArray` Type
The `ReadonlyArray` is a special type that describes arrays that shouldn’t be changed.
```ts
function doStuff(values: ReadonlyArray<string>) {

  // We can read from 'values'...
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  // Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
  values.push("hello!");
}
```

Much like the `readonly` modifier for properties, it’s mainly a tool we can use for intent. When we see a function that returns `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us we’re not meant to change the contents at all, and when we see a function that consumes `ReadonlyArray`s, it tells us that we can pass any array into that function without worrying that it will change its contents.

Unlike `Array`, there isn’t a `ReadonlyArray` constructor that we can use.
```ts
// 'ReadonlyArray' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
new ReadonlyArray("red", "green", "blue");
```

Instead, we can assign regular `Array`s to `ReadonlyArray`s.
```ts
const roArray: ReadonlyArray<string> = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Just as TypeScript provides a shorthand syntax for `Array<Type>` with `Type[]`, it also provides a shorthand syntax for `ReadonlyArray<Type>` with `readonly Type[]`.
```ts
function doStuff(values: readonly string[]) {

  // We can read from 'values'...
  const copy = values.slice();
  console.log(`The first value is ${values[0]}`);

  // ...but we can't mutate 'values'.
  // Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly string[]'.
  values.push("hello!");
}
```

One last thing to note is that unlike the `readonly` property modifier, assignability isn’t bidirectional between regular `Array`s and `ReadonlyArray`s.
```ts
let x: readonly string[] = [];
let y: string[] = [];

x = y;

// The type 'readonly string[]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'string[]'.
y = x;
```

### Tuple Types
A tuple type is another sort of `Array` type that knows exactly how many elements it contains, and exactly which types it contains at specific positions.
```ts
type StringNumberPair = [string, number];
```

Here, `StringNumberPair` is a tuple type of `string` and `number`. Like `ReadonlyArray`, it has no representation at runtime, but is significant to TypeScript. To the type system, `StringNumberPair` describes arrays whose `0` index contains a `string` and whose `1` index contains a `number`.
```ts
function doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {

  // const a: string
  const a = pair[0];

  // const b: number
  const b = pair[1];

  // ...
}

doSomething(["hello", 42]);
```

If we try to index past the number of elements, we’ll get an error.
```ts
function doSomething(pair: [string, number]) {
  // ...

  // Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.
  const c = pair[2];
}
```

We can also destructure tuples using JavaScript’s array destructuring.
```ts
function doSomething(stringHash: [string, number]) {
  const [inputString, hash] = stringHash;

  // const inputString: string
  console.log(inputString);

  // const hash: number
  console.log(hash);
}
```

<br />

<hr />

Tuple types are useful in heavily convention-based APIs, where each element’s meaning is “obvious”. This gives us flexibility in whatever we want to name our variables when we destructure them. In the above example, we were able to name elements `0` and `1` to whatever we wanted.

However, since not every user holds the same view of what’s obvious, it may be worth reconsidering whether using objects with descriptive property names may be better for your API.

<hr />

Other than those length checks, simple tuple types like these are equivalent to types which are versions of `Array`s that declare properties for specific indexes, and that declare `length` with a numeric literal type.
```ts
interface StringNumberPair {

  // specialized properties
  length: 2;
  0: string;
  1: number;

  // Other 'Array<string | number>' members...
  slice(start?: number, end?: number): Array<string | number>;
}
```

Another thing you may be interested in is that tuples can have optional properties by writing out a question mark (`?` after an element’s type). Optional tuple elements can only come at the end, and also affect the type of `length`.
```ts
type Either2dOr3d = [number, number, number?];

function setCoordinate(coord: Either2dOr3d) {

  // const z: number | undefined
  const [x, y, z] = coord;

  // length: 2 | 3
  console.log(`Provided coordinates had ${coord.length} dimensions`);
}
```

Tuples can also have rest elements, which have to be an array/tuple type.
```ts
type StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];
type StringBooleansNumber = [string, ...boolean[], number];
type BooleansStringNumber = [...boolean[], string, number];
```

##### `StringNumberBooleans`
- describes a tuple whose first two elements are `string` and `number` respectively, but which may have any number of `boolean`s following.

##### `StringBooleansNumber`
- describes a tuple whose first element is `string` and then any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `number`.

##### `BooleansStringNumber`
- describes a tuple whose starting elements are any number of `boolean`s and ending with a `string` then a `number`.

A tuple with a rest element has no set “length” - it only has a set of well-known elements in different positions.
```ts
const a: StringNumberBooleans = ["hello", 1];
const b: StringNumberBooleans = ["beautiful", 2, true];
const c: StringNumberBooleans = ["world", 3, true, false, true, false, true];
```

Why might optional and rest elements be useful? Well, it allows TypeScript to correspond tuples with parameter lists. Tuples types can be used in rest parameters and arguments, so that the following:
```ts
function readButtonInput(...args: [string, number, ...boolean[]]) {
  const [name, version, ...input] = args;
  // ...
}
```

is basically equivalent to:
```ts
function readButtonInput(name: string, version: number, ...input: boolean[]) {
  // ...
}
```

This is handy when you want to take a variable number of arguments with a rest parameter, and you need a minimum number of elements, but you don’t want to introduce intermediate variables.

### `readonly` Tuple Types
One final note about tuple types - tuple types have `readonly` variants, and can be specified by sticking a `readonly` modifier in front of them - just like with array shorthand syntax.
```ts
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {
  // ...
}
```

As you might expect, writing to any property of a `readonly` tuple isn’t allowed in TypeScript.
```ts
function doSomething(pair: readonly [string, number]) {

  // Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.
  pair[0] = "hello!";
}
```

Tuples tend to be created and left un-modified in most code, so annotating types as `readonly` tuples when possible is a good default. This is also important given that array literals with `const` assertions will be inferred with `readonly` tuple types.
```ts
let point = [3, 4] as const;

function distanceFromOrigin([x, y]: [number, number]) {
  return Math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2);
}

// Argument of type 'readonly [3, 4]' is not assignable to parameter of type '[number, number]'.
// The type 'readonly [3, 4]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[number, number]'.
distanceFromOrigin(point);
```

Here, `distanceFromOrigin` never modifies its elements, but expects a mutable tuple. Since `point`’s type was inferred as `readonly [3, 4]`, it won’t be compatible with `[number, number]` since that type can’t guarantee `point`’s elements won’t be mutated.

const math = {
  sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  },
};
```

다음은 속성이 함수 표현식인 예제다.
```ts
const math = {
  sum: function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  },
};
```

속성이 (리턴을 생략한) 화살표 함수인 예제다.
```ts
const math = {
  sum: (a: number, b: number): number => a + b,
};
```

아쉽지만, 함수 스스로를 정의할 수 없는 타입을 작성하기 위해서는 객체로 감싸는 형태로 타입을 정의해야 한다. 객체 리터럴 안에 정의될 때는 속성의 함수 타입을 스스로 지정할 수 없다.
```ts
type MathFn = (a: number, b: number) => number;

const math: { sum: MathFn } = {
  sum: (a, b) => a + b,
};
```

심지어, 앞선 예제처럼 타입에 속성을 추가하려고 한다면 객체 리터럴 안에서는 불가능하다. 함수 선언을 완전하게 타입 정의해야 한다.
```ts
type MathFn = {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
  operator: string;
};
const sum: MathFn = (a, b) => a + b;
sum.operator = '+';

const math = { sum };
```

이 예제는 const math = {sum}에 더하기만 추가한 앞선 예제와 같다는 것을 눈치챘을 것이다. 그렇다, 객체 선언에서 이 모든 것을 인라인화할 수 있는 방법은 없다.
