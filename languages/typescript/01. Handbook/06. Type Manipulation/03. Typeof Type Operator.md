`Typeof` Type Operator
======================

## `typeof` <sub>(타입 연산자)</sub>
JavaScript already has a `typeof` operator you can use in an expression context:
```ts
// Prints "string"
console.log(typeof "Hello world");
```

TypeScript adds a `typeof` operator you can use in a type context to refer to the type of a variable or property:
```ts
let s = "hello";

// let n: string
let n: typeof s;
```

This isn’t very useful for basic types, but combined with other type operators, you can use `typeof` to conveniently express many patterns. For an example, let’s start by looking at the predefined type `ReturnType<T>`. It takes a function type and produces its return type:
```ts
type Predicate = (x: unknown) => boolean;

// type K = boolean
type K = ReturnType<Predicate>;
```

If we try to use `ReturnType` on a function name, we see an instructive error:
```ts
function f() {
  return { x: 10, y: 3 };
}

// 'f' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof f'?
type P = ReturnType<f>;
```

Remember that values and types aren’t the same thing. To refer to the type that the value f has, we use `typeof`:
```ts
function f() {
  return { x: 10, y: 3 };
}

/*
type P = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}
 */
type P = ReturnType<typeof f>;

```

### Limitations
TypeScript intentionally limits the sorts of expressions you can use `typeof` on.

Specifically, it’s only legal to use `typeof` on identifiers (i.e. variable names) or their properties. This helps avoid the confusing trap of writing code you think is executing, but isn’t:
```ts
// Meant to use = ReturnType<typeof msgbox>
// ',' expected.
let shouldContinue: typeof msgbox("Are you sure you want to continue?");
```
