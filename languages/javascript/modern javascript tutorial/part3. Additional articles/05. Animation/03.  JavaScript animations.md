JavaScript animations
=====================

JavaScript animations can handle things that CSS can’t.

For instance, moving along a complex path, with a timing function different from Bezier curves, or an animation on a canvas.

### Using setInterval
An animation can be implemented as a sequence of frames – usually small changes to HTML/CSS properties.

For instance, changing style.left from 0px to 100px moves the element. And if we increase it in setInterval, changing by 2px with a tiny delay, like 50 times per second, then it looks smooth. That’s the same principle as in the cinema: 24 frames per second is enough to make it look smooth.

The pseudo-code can look like this:
```javascript
let timer = setInterval(function() {
  if (animation complete) clearInterval(timer);
  else increase style.left by 2px
}, 20); // change by 2px every 20ms, about 50 frames per second
```

More complete example of the animation:
```javascript
let start = Date.now(); // remember start time

let timer = setInterval(function() {
  // how much time passed from the start?
  let timePassed = Date.now() - start;

  if (timePassed >= 2000) {
    clearInterval(timer); // finish the animation after 2 seconds
    return;
  }

  // draw the animation at the moment timePassed
  draw(timePassed);

}, 20);

// as timePassed goes from 0 to 2000
// left gets values from 0px to 400px
function draw(timePassed) {
  train.style.left = timePassed / 5 + 'px';
}
```
