```javascript
timingEaseOut(timeFraction) = 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction);
```

In other words, we have a "transform" function `makeEaseOut` that takes a "regular" timing function and returns the wrapper around it:
```javascript
// accepts a timing function, returns the transformed variant
function makeEaseOut(timing) {
  return function(timeFraction) {
    return 1 - timing(1 - timeFraction);
  }
}
```

For instance, we can take the `bounce` function described above and apply it:
```javascript
let bounceEaseOut = makeEaseOut(bounce);
```

Then the bounce will be not in the beginning, but at the end of the animation. Looks even better:

```

Here we can see how the transform changes the behavior of the function:

![bounce-inout](../../images/03/05/03/bounce-inout.svg)

If there's an animation effect in the beginning, like bouncing – it will be shown at the end.

In the graph above the 🟠regular bounce🟠 has the red color, and the 🔵easeOut bounce🔵 is blue.
- Regular bounce – the object bounces at the bottom, then at the end sharply jumps to the top.
- After `easeOut` – it first jumps to the top, then bounces there.

#### easeInOut
We also can show the effect both in the beginning and the end of the animation. The transform is called "easeInOut".

Given the timing function, we calculate the animation state like this:
```javascript
if (timeFraction <= 0.5) { // first half of the animation
  return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;
} else { // second half of the animation
  return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;
}
```

The wrapper code:
```javascript
function makeEaseInOut(timing) {
  return function(timeFraction) {
    if (timeFraction < .5)
      return timing(2 * timeFraction) / 2;
    else
      return (2 - timing(2 * (1 - timeFraction))) / 2;
  }
}

bounceEaseInOut = makeEaseInOut(bounce);
```

In action, `bounceEaseInOut`:

#path { outline: 1px solid #E8C48E; width: 540px; height: 20px; }
```

The "easeInOut" transform joins two graphs into one: `easeIn` (regular) for the first half of the animation and `easeOut` (reversed) – for the second part.

The effect is clearly seen if we compare the graphs of `easeIn`, easeOu`t and `easeInOut` of the `circ` timing function:

![circ-ease](../../images/03/05/03/circ-ease.svg)

- 🔴Red🔴 is the regular variantof `circ` (`easeIn`).
- 🟢Green🟢 – `easeOut`.
- 🔵Blue🔵 – `easeInOut`.

As we can see, the graph of the first half of the animation is the scaled down `easeIn`, and the second half is the scaled down `easeOut`. As a result, the animation starts and finishes with the same effect.

### More interesting "draw"
Instead of moving the element we can do something else. All we need is to write the write the proper `draw`.

Here's the animated "bouncing" text typing:

## 요약
For animations that CSS can't handle well, or those that need tight control, JavaScript can help. JavaScript animations should be implemented via `requestAnimationFrame`. That built-in method allows to setup a callback function to run when the browser will be preparing a repaint. Usually that's very soon, but the exact time depends on the browser.

When a page is in the background, there are no repaints at all, so the callback won't run: the animation will be suspended and won't consume resources. That's great.

Here's the helper `animate` function to setup most animations:
```javascript
function animate({timing, draw, duration}) {

  let start = performance.now();

  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {
    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1
    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;
    if (timeFraction > 1) timeFraction = 1;

    // calculate the current animation state
    let progress = timing(timeFraction);

    draw(progress); // draw it

    if (timeFraction < 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }

  });
}
```

Options:
- `duration` – the total animation time in ms.
- `timing` – the function to calculate animation progress. Gets a time fraction from 0 to 1, returns the animation progress, usually from 0 to 1.
- `draw` – the function to draw the animation.

Surely we could improve it, add more bells and whistles, but JavaScript animations are not applied on a daily basis. They are used to do something interesting and non-standard. So you'd want to add the features that you need when you need them.

JavaScript animations can use any timing function. We covered a lot of examples and transformations to make them even more versatile. Unlike CSS, we are not limited to Bezier curves here.

The same is about `draw`: we can animate anything, not just CSS properties.

### Animate the bouncing ball
Make a bouncing ball. Click to see how it should look:

To bounce we can use CSS property `top` and `position:absolute` for the ball inside the field with `position:relative`.

The bottom coordinate of the field is `field.clientHeight`. The `top` <sub>(CSS 프로퍼티)</sub> refers to the upper edge of the ball. So it should go from `0` till `field.clientHeight` - `ball.clientHeight`, that's the final lowest position of the upper edge of the ball.

To to get the "bouncing" effect we can use the timing function `bounce` in `easeOut` mode.

Here's the final code for the animation:
```javascript
let to = field.clientHeight - ball.clientHeight;

animate({
  duration: 2000,
  timing: makeEaseOut(bounce),
  draw(progress) {
    ball.style.top = to * progress + 'px'
  }
});
```

### Animate the ball bouncing to the right
Make the ball bounce to the right. Like this:

![assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-1](../../images/03/05/03/assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-1.png)
![assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-2](../../images/03/05/03/assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-2.png)
![assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-3](../../images/03/05/03/assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-3.png)
![assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-4](../../images/03/05/03/assignment-animate-the-ball-bouncing-to-the-right-4.png)

Write the animation code. The distance to the left is `100px`.

Take the solution of the previous task as the source.

<br />

<img src="../../images/commons/icons/circle-answer.svg" />

In the previous, we had only one property to animate. Now we need one more: `elem.style.left`.

The horizontal coordinate changes by another law: it does not "bounce", but gradually increases shifting the ball to the right.

We can write one more `animate` for it.

As the time function we could use `linear`, but something like `makeEaseOut(quad)` looks much better.

The code:
```javascript
let height = field.clientHeight - ball.clientHeight;
let width = 100;

// animate top (bouncing)
animate({
  duration: 2000,
  timing: makeEaseOut(bounce),
  draw: function(progress) {
    ball.style.top = height * progress + 'px'
  }
});

// animate left (moving to the right)
animate({
  duration: 2000,
  timing: makeEaseOut(quad),
  draw: function(progress) {
    ball.style.left = width * progress + "px"
  }
});
```
