`\N` · `\k<name>` <sub>(패턴 내 역참조)</sub>
==========================================

##### 캡처링 그룹 내용 <sub>(`(…)`)</sub>
- 패턴 내 사용 가능

### 숫자 역참조

##### `\N`
- `\` + 그룹 숫자

#### 따옴표 문장 <sub>(`"…"` · `'…'`)</sub> 검색

##### `['"](.*?)['"]`
- 두 따옴표 <sub>(`"` · `'`)</sub> 구별 X
  - `"…'`
  - `'…"`

##### `"She's the one!"`
```javascript
let str = `He said: "She's the one!".`;
let regexp = /['"](.*?)['"]/g;

// "She' (부적절한 검색 결과)
alert( str.match(regexp) );
```

##### `(['"])(.*?)\1`
- 여는 따옴표 검색 시
  1. 캡처링 그룹화
  2. 패턴 내 그룹 내용 참조 <sub>(닫는 따옴표 위치)</sub>
```javascript
let str = `He said: "She's the one!".`;

let regexp = /(['"])(.*?)\1/g;

alert( str.match(regexp) ); // "She's the one!"
```

Now it works! The regular expression engine finds the first quote `(['"])` and memorizes its content. That's the first capturing group.

Further in the pattern `\1` means "find the same text as in the first group", exactly the same quote in our case.

Similar to that, `\2` would mean the contents of the second group, `\3` – the 3rd group, and so on.

If we use `?:` in the group, then we can't reference it. Groups that are excluded from capturing `(?:...)` are not memorized by the engine.

<br />

<img src="../../images/commons/icons/triangle-exclamation-solid.svg" /> **Don't mess up: in the pattern `\1`, in the replacement: `$1`**

In the replacement string we use a dollar sign: `$1`, while in the pattern – a backslash `\1`.

### Backreference by name: `\k<name>`
If a regexp has many parentheses, it's convenient to give them names.

To reference a named group we can use `\k<name>`.

In the example below the group with quotes is named `?<quote>`, so the backreference is `\k<quote>`:
```javascript
let str = `He said: "She's the one!".`;

let regexp = /(?<quote>['"])(.*?)\k<quote>/g;

alert( str.match(regexp) ); // "She's the one!"
```
