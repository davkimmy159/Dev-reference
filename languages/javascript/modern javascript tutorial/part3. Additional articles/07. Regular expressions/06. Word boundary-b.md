There are three different positions that qualify as word boundaries:
- At string start, if the first string character is a word character `\w`.
- Between two characters in the string, where one is a word character `\w` and the other is not.
- At string end, if the last string character is a word character `\w`.

- `Hello, Java!`
  - `Java` <sub>(단일 문자)</sub>
- `Hello, JavaScript!` X
  - `null`
  - `JavaScript` <sub>(복합 문자)</sub>

##### `\bJava\b`

|문자열|일치 결과||
|---|---|---|
|`"Hello, Java!"`|`Java`|`Java` <sub>(단일 문자)</sub>|
|`"Hello, JavaScript!"`|`null`|`JavaScript` <sub>(복합 문자)</sub>

```javascript
// Java
alert( "Hello, Java!".match(/\bJava\b/) );

// null
alert( "Hello, JavaScript!".match(/\bJava\b/) );
```

In the string `Hello, Java!` following positions correspond to `\b`:

![hello-java-boundaries](../../images/03/07/06/hello-java-boundaries.svg)

So, it matches the pattern `\bHello\b`, because:
1. At the beginning of the string matches the first test `\b`.
2. Then matches the word `Hello`.
3. Then the test `\b` matches again, as we're between `o` and a comma.

The pattern `\bHello\b` would also match. But not `\bHell\b` (because there's no word boundary after `l`) and not `Java!\b` (because the exclamation sign is not a wordly character `\w`, so there's no word boundary after it).

##### `"Hello, Java!".match(/*/)`

|정규 표현식|일치 결과|
|---|---|
|`\bHello\b`|`Hello`|
|`\bJava\b`|`Java`|
|`\bHell\b`|`null`|
|`\bJava!\b`|`null`|

We can use `\b` not only with words, but with digits as well.

For example, the pattern `\b\d\d\b` looks for standalone 2-digit numbers. In other words, it looks for 2-digit numbers that are surrounded by characters different from `\w`, such as spaces or punctuation (or text start/end).
```javascript
alert( "1 23 456 78".match(/\b\d\d\b/g) ); // 23,78
alert( "12,34,56".match(/\b\d\d\b/g) ); // 12,34,56
```

The word boundary test `\b` checks that there should be `\w` on the one side from the position and "not `\w`" – on the other side.

But `\w` means a latin letter `a-z` (or a digit or an underscore), so the test doesn't work for other characters, e.g. cyrillic letters or hieroglyphs.

### Find the time
The time has a format: `hours:minutes`. Both hours and minutes has two digits, like `09:00`.

Make a regexp to find time in the string: `Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456`.

P.S. In this task there's no need to check time correctness yet, so `25:99` can also be a valid result.

P.P.S. The regexp shouldn't match `123:456`.

The answer: `\b\d\d:\d\d\b`.
```javascript
alert( "Breakfast at 09:00 in the room 123:456.".match( /\b\d\d:\d\d\b/ ) ); // 09:00
```
