### Transactions
The term "transaction" is generic, used in many kinds of databases.

A transaction is a group operations, that should either all succeed or all fail.

For instance, when a person buys something, we need to:
1. Subtract the money from their account.
2. Add the item to their inventory.

It would be pretty bad if we complete the 1st operation, and then something goes wrong, e.g. lights out, and we fail to do the 2nd. Both should either succeed (purchase complete, good!) or both fail (at least the person kept their money, so they can retry).

Transactions can guarantee that.

**All data operations must be made within a transaction in IndexedDB.**

To start a transaction:
```jakearchibald
db.transaction(store[, type]);
```
- `store` is a store name that the transaction is going to access, e.g. `"books"`. Can be an array of store names if we're going to access multiple stores.
- `type` – a transaction type, one of:
  - `readonly` – can only read, the default.
  - `readwrite` – can only read and write the data, but not create/remove/alter object stores.

There's also `versionchange` transaction type: such transactions can do everything, but we can't create them manually. IndexedDB automatically creates a `versionchange` transaction when opening the database, for `updateneeded` handler. That's why it's a single place where we can update the database structure, create/remove object stores.

<br />

<img src="../../images/commons/icons/circle-exclamation-solid.svg" /> **Why are there different types of transactions?**

Performance is the reason why transactions need to be labeled either `readonly` and `readwrite`.

Many `readonly` transactions are able to access the same store concurrently, but `readwrite` transactions can't. A `readwrite` transaction "locks" the store for writing. The next transaction must wait before the previous one finishes before accessing the same store.

<br />

After the transaction is created, we can add an item to the store, like this:
```javascript
let transaction = db.transaction("books", "readwrite"); // (1)

// get an object store to operate on it
let books = transaction.objectStore("books"); // (2)

let book = {
  id: 'js',
  price: 10,
  created: new Date()
};

let request = books.add(book); // (3)

request.onsuccess = function() { // (4)
  console.log("Book added to the store", request.result);
};

request.onerror = function() {
  console.log("Error", request.error);
};
```

There were basically four steps:
1. Create a transaction, mentioning all the stores it's going to access, at `(1)`.
2. Get the store object using `transaction.objectStore(name)`, at `(2)`.
3. Perform the request to the object store `books.add(book)`, at `(3)`.
4. …Handle request success/error `(4)`, then we can make other requests if needed, etc.

Object stores support two methods to store a value:
- **`put(value, [key])`** Add the `value` to the store. The `key` is supplied only if the object store did not have `keyPath` or `autoIncrement` option. If there's already a value with the same key, it will be replaced.
- **`add(value, [key])`** Same as `put`, but if there's already a value with the same key, then the request fails, and an error with the name `"ConstraintError"` is generated.

Similar to opening a database, we can send a request: `books.add(book)`, and then wait for `success`/`error` events.
- The `request.result` for `add` is the key of the new object.
- The error is in `request.error` (if any).

### Transactions' autocommit
In the example above we started the transaction and made `add` request. But as we stated previously, a transaction may have multiple associated requests, that must either all succeed or all fail. How do we mark the transaction as finished, with no more requests to come?

The short answer is: we don't.

In the next version 3.0 of the specification, there will probably be a manual way to finish the transaction, but right now in 2.0 there isn't.

**When all transaction requests are finished, and the microtasks queue is empty, it is committed automatically.**

Usually, we can assume that a transaction commits when all its requests are complete, and the current code finishes.

So, in the example above no special call is needed to finish the transaction.

Transactions auto-commit principle has an important side effect. We can't insert an async operation like `fetch`, `setTimeout` in the middle of transaction. IndexedDB will not keep the transaction waiting till these are done.

In the code below, `request2` in line `(*)` fails, because the transaction is already committed, and can't make any request in it:
```javascript
let request1 = books.add(book);

request1.onsuccess = function() {
  fetch('/').then(response => {
    let request2 = books.add(anotherBook); // (*)
    request2.onerror = function() {
      console.log(request2.error.name); // TransactionInactiveError
    };
  });
};
```

That's because `fetch` is an asynchronous operation, a macrotask. Transactions are closed before the browser starts doing macrotasks.

Authors of IndexedDB spec believe that transactions should be short-lived. Mostly for performance reasons.

Notably, `readwrite` transactions "lock" the stores for writing. So if one part of application initiated `readwrite` on `books` object store, then another part that wants to do the same has to wait: the new transaction "hangs" till the first one is done. That can lead to strange delays if transactions take a long time.

So, what to do?

In the example above we could make a new `db.transaction` right before the new request `(*)`.

But it will be even better, if we'd like to keep the operations together, in one transaction, to split apart IndexedDB transactions and "other" async stuff.

First, make `fetch`, prepare the data if needed, afterwards create a transaction and perform all the database requests, it'll work then.

To detect the moment of successful completion, we can listen to `transaction.oncomplete` event:
```javascript
let transaction = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");

// ...perform operations...

transaction.oncomplete = function() {
  console.log("Transaction is complete");
};
```

Only `complete` guarantees that the transaction is saved as a whole. Individual requests may succeed, but the final write operation may go wrong (e.g. I/O error or something).

To manually abort the transaction, call:
```javascript
transaction.abort();
```

That cancels all modification made by the requests in it and triggers `transaction.onabort` event.
