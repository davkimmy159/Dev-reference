The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB, is event-based.

We can also use `async`/`await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb. That's pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can't replace events for all cases. So we'll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we'll use the wrapper.

### Open database
To start working with IndexedDB, we first need to `open` (connect to) a database.

The syntax:
```javascript
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(name, version);
```

- `name` – a string, the database name.
- `version` – a positive integer version, by default `1` (explained below).

We can have many databases with different names, but all of them exist within the current origin (domain/protocol/port). Different websites can't access each other's databases.

The call returns `openRequest` object, we should listen to events on it:
- `success`: database is ready, there's the "database object" in `openRequest.result`, that we should use it for further calls.
- `error`: opening failed.
- `upgradeneeded`: database is ready, but its version is outdated (see below).

**IndexedDB has a built-in mechanism of "schema versioning", absent in server-side databases.**

Unlike server-side databases, IndexedDB is client-side, the data is stored in the browser, so we, developers, don't have full-time access to it. So, when we have published a new version of our app, and the user visits our webpage, we may need to update the database.

If the local database version is less than specified in `open`, then a special event `upgradeneeded` is triggered, and we can compare versions and upgrade data structures as needed.

The `upgradeneeded` event also triggers when the database doesn't yet exist (technically, it's version is `0`), so we can perform the initialization.

Let's say we published the first version of our app.

Then we can open the database with version `1` and perform the initialization in an `upgradeneeded` handler like this:
```javascript
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 1);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```

Then, later, we publish the 2nd version.

We can open it with version `2` and perform the upgrade like this:
```javascript
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 2);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  // the existing database version is less than 2 (or it doesn't exist)
  let db = openRequest.result;
  switch(event.oldVersion) { // existing db version
    case 0:
      // version 0 means that the client had no database
      // perform initialization
    case 1:
      // client had version 1
      // update
  }
};
```

Please note: as our current version is `2`, `onupgradeneeded` handler has a code branch for version `0`, suitable for users that are accessing for the first time and have no database, and also for version `1`, for upgrades.

And then, only if `onupgradeneeded` handler finishes without errors, `openRequest.onsuccess` triggers, and the database is considered successfully opened.

To delete a database:
```javascript
let deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(name)
// deleteRequest.onsuccess/onerror tracks the result
```

<img src="../../images/commons/icons/triangle-exclamation-solid.svg" /> **We can't open an older version of the database**

If the current user database has a higher version than in the `open` call, e.g. the existing DB version is `3`, and we try to `open(...2)`, then that's an error, `openRequest.onerror` triggers.

That's rare, but such a thing may happen when a visitor loads outdated JavaScript code, e.g. from a proxy cache. So the code is old, but his database is new.

To protect from errors, we should check `db.version` and suggest a page reload. Use proper HTTP caching headers to avoid loading the old code, so that you'll never have such problems.

<br />

#### Parallel update problem
As we're talking about versioning, let's tackle a small related problem.

Let's say:
1. A visitor opened our site in a browser tab, with database version `1`.
2. Then we rolled out an update, so our code is newer.
3. And then the same visitor opens our site in another tab.

So there's a tab with an open connection to DB version `1`, while the second tab one attempts to update it to version `2` in its `upgradeneeded` handler.

The problem is that a database is shared between two tabs, as it's the same site, same origin. And it can't be both version `1` and `2`. To perform the update to version `2`, all connections to version 1 must be closed, including the one in the first tab.

In order to organize that, the `versionchange` event triggers on the "outdated" database object. We should listen for it and close the old database connection (and probably suggest a page reload, to load the updated code).

If we don't listen for the `versionchange` event and don't close the old connection, then the second, new connection won't be made. The `openRequest` object will emit the `blocked` event instead of `success`. So the second tab won't work.

Here's the code to correctly handle the parallel upgrade.

It installs an `onversionchange` handler after the database is opened, that closes the old connection:
```javascript
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 2);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = ...;
openRequest.onerror = ...;

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;

  db.onversionchange = function() {
    db.close();
    alert("Database is outdated, please reload the page.")
  };

  // ...the db is ready, use it...
};

openRequest.onblocked = function() {
  // this event shouldn't trigger if we handle onversionchange correctly

  // it means that there's another open connection to same database
  // and it wasn't closed after db.onversionchange triggered for them
};
```

Here we do two things:
1. Add `db.onversionchange` listener after a successful opening, to be informed about a parallel update attempt.
2. Add `openRequest.onblocked` listener to handle the case when an old connection wasn't closed. This doesn't happen if we close it in `db.onversionchange`.

There are other variants. For example, we can take the time to close things gracefully in `db.onversionchange`, and prompt the visitor to save the data before the connection is closed. The new updating connection will be blocked immediately after `db.onversionchange` has finished without closing, and we can ask the visitor in the new tab to close other tabs for the update.

These update collisions happen rarely, but we should at least have some handling for them, e.g. `onblocked` handler, so that our script doesn't surprise the user by dying silently.

### Object store
To store something in IndexedDB, we need an object store.

An object store is a core concept of IndexedDB. Counterparts in other databases are called "tables" or "collections". It's where the data is stored. A database may have multiple stores: one for users, another one for goods, etc.

Despite being named an "object store", primitives can be stored too.

**We can store almost any value, including complex objects.**

IndexedDB uses the [standard serialization algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#section-structuredserializeforstorage) to clone-and-store an object. It's like `JSON.stringify`, but more powerful, capable of storing much more datatypes.

An example of an object that can't be stored: an object with circular references. Such objects are not serializable. JSON.stringify also fails for such objects.

**There must be a unique `key` for every value in the store.**

A key must be one of the these types – number, date, string, binary, or array. It's a unique identifier, so we can search/remove/update values by the key.

![indexeddb-structure](../../images/03/04/03/indexeddb-structure.svg)

As we'll see very soon, we can provide a key when we add a value to the store, similar to `localStorage`. But when we store objects, IndexedDB allows setting up an object property as the key, which is much more convenient. Or we can auto-generate keys.

But we need to create an object store first.

The syntax to create an object store:
```jakearchibald
db.createObjectStore(name[, keyOptions]);
```

Please note, the operation is synchronous, no `await` needed.
- `name` is the store name, e.g. `"books"` for books,
- `keyOptions` is an optional object with one of two properties:
  - `keyPath` – a path to an object property that IndexedDB will use as the key, e.g. `id`.
  - `autoIncrement` – if `true`, then the key for a newly stored object is generated automatically, as an ever-incrementing number.

If we don't supply `keyOptions`, then we'll need to provide a key explicitly later, when storing an object.

For instance, this object store uses `id` property as the key:
```jakearchibald
db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'});
```

**An object store can only be created/modified while updating the DB version, in `upgradeneeded` handler.**

That's a technical limitation. Outside of the handler we'll be able to add/remove/update the data, but object stores can only be created/removed/altered during a version update.

To perform a database version upgrade, there are two main approaches:
1. We can implement per-version upgrade functions: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4 etc. Then, in `upgradeneeded` we can compare versions (e.g. old 2, now 4) and run per-version upgrades step by step, for every intermediate version (2 to 3, then 3 to 4).
2. Or we can just examine the database: get a list of existing object stores as `db.objectStoreNames`. That object is a [DOMStringList](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#domstringlist) that provides `contains(name)` method to check for existance. And then we can do updates depending on what exists and what doesn't.

For small databases the second variant may be simpler.

Here's the demo of the second approach:
```javascript
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("db", 2);

// create/upgrade the database without version checks
openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('books')) { // if there's no "books" store
    db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'}); // create it
  }
};
```

To delete an object store:
```javascript
db.deleteObjectStore('books')
```
